## 📝 About Me

A Machine Learning Engineer passionate about turning data into intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Experienced in designing, training, and deploying AI models that make technology smarter, faster, and more impactful.

Skilled in building end-to-end AI/ML pipelines, from data collection and preprocessing to model development, optimization, and deployment at scale. Proficient in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SQL, Pandas, and NumPy, with a strong focus on delivering solutions that are both accurate and production-ready.

**Hands-on experience includes:**
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision – image classification, defect detection, and object recognition.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – chatbots, sentiment analysis, and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
- Generative AI – prompt engineering, LLM customization, and GPT-style architectures for automation and creativity.
- Predictive Analytics & Forecasting – customer churn prediction, financial modeling, and trend forecasting.
- Recommendation Systems – personalization engines that improve engagement and retention.

Focused on **MLOps and scalable deployment**, with expertise in cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), APIs, and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

Dedicated to the belief that AI should not only disrupt industries but also create meaningful impact across healthcare, sustainability, accessibility, and education. Open to collaboration, research, and innovation that pushes the boundaries of artificial intelligence while ensuring practical, ethical, and scalable deployment.
